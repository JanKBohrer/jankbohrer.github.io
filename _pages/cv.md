Programming and Software
------
For my Master thesis, I wrote a Python program from scratch for the simulation of cloud particles, utilizing the just-in-time compiler Numba. Furthermore, I have advanced experience with data analysis and visualization and basic knowledge of data driven optimization methods in Python. Additionally, I can read and write C/C++ on a basic level and got some experience with CFD codes (OpenFOAM and Cadence OMNIS). During my time as wind farm assessor, I worked with EMD windPRO and Windographer for Wind farm planning and wind data analysis.

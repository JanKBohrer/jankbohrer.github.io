I am a Research Master Student at the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI), currently working on LIDAR based wind measurements and wind farm layout optimization and control, including data-driven methods. I have a Master in Physics and a Bachelor in Energy Science and worked as wind resource assessor at a wind farm developer in Germany.

## Interests

- Dynamics of complex systems, atmospheric physics and earth system modeling
- Renewable energies, wind farm modeling and control, wake interactions and vortex dynamics
- Sustainability, climate change mitigation, understanding and preservation of natural ecosystems
